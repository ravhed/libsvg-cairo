libsvg-cairo - Render SVG content using cairo

Description
-----------
libsvg-cairo provides the ability to render SVG content from files or
buffers. All rendering is performed using the cairo rendering library.

Dependencies
------------
libsvg-cairo depends on libsvg and cairo. It should be easy to build on
any reasonable system.

Documentation
-------------
libsvg-cairo is accessed by including its public header file:

#include <svg-cairo.h>

For now, that header file contains all existing documentation. But it
was intentionally designed to be very intuitive to use without
excessive explanations.

History
-------
libsvg-cairo was developed by Carl Worth <cworth@isi.edu>
